Key Question: We are interested in predicting which people would be likely to convert from free users to premium subscribers in the next 6 month period, if they are targeted by our promotional campaign.

Resrources: Dataset contains 41,540 records (1540 adopters and 40,000 non-adopters), each record representing a different user of the XYZ website who was targeted in the previous marketing campaign. Each record is described with 25 attributes.
